My interactive Bullet Journal - Inspired by  http://www.bulletjournal.com/ 

All the basics principles specified here: http://bulletjournal.com/get-started/ 
## Why ? 

I use a Bullet Journal everyday everywhere to organize my work and also my life. 

It's a very useful method to organize all imaginable tasks. 
But after a moment, if you are an "HARDCORE" user you can quickly reach the pratical limits of the method. You will need to use severals diarys to represent the various Bujo modules. Becoming almost impossible to maintain and very time-consuming.
